# Buddy

A group project made by the Quarantine Buddies at HackMIT 2020!

In a global pandemic, it’s easy to lose touch with ourselves – we’re trapped in quarantine, both physically and mentally. With Buddy, our goal is to help users promote healthy habits to check in on their mental health! Buddy, the perfect quarantine buddy, takes in daily entries to the Question of the Day, Journal Entries, and Mood Tracker, then analyzes the tone of user input to respond with positive affirmations and advice.
